--
-- The next task requires to create several data types and functions to
-- model the given situation.
--
-- An evil dragon attacked a village of innocent citizens! After
-- returning to its lair, the dragon became hungry and ate one of its
-- treasure chests by accident.
--
-- The guild in the village found a brave knight to slay the dragon!
-- As a reward, the knight can take the treasure chest.
--
-- Below is the description of the fight and character specifications:
--
--   * A chest contains a non-zero amount of gold and a possible treasure.
--   * As a reward, knight takes all the gold, the treasure and experience.
--   * Experience is calculated based on the dragon type. A dragon can be
--     either red, black or green.
--   * Red dragons grant 100 experience points, black dragons â€” 150, and green â€” 250.
--   * Stomachs of green dragons contain extreme acid and they melt any
--     treasure except gold. So green dragons has only gold as reward.
--     All other dragons always contain treasure in addition to gold.
--   * Knight tries to slay dragon with their sword. Each sword strike
--     decreases dragon health by the "sword attack" amount. When the
--     dragon health becomes zero or less, a dragon dies and the knight
--     takes the reward.
--   * After each 10 sword strikes, dragon breathes fire and decreases
--     knight health by the amount of "dragon fire power". If the
--     knight's health becomes 0 or less, the knight dies.
--   * Additionally, each sword strike decreases "knight's endurance" by one.
--     If knight's endurance becomes zero, they become tired and are not
--     able to continue the fight so they run away.
--
-- Implement data types to describe treasure, knight and dragon.
-- And implement a function that takes a knight and a dragon and returns
-- one of the three possible fight outcomes.
--
-- You're free to define any helper functions.
--
-- ðŸ•¯ HINT: If you find the description overwhelming to implement entirely
--   from scratch, try modelling the problem in stages.
--
--     1. Implement all custom data types without using polymorphism.
--     2. Add @newtype@s for safety where you think is appropriate.
--     3. Encode the fight result as a sum type.
--     4. Add polymorphism.
--     5. Make all invalid states unrepresentable. Think, how you can
--        change your types to prevent green dragons from having any
--        treasure besides gold (if you already haven't done this).

-- some help in the beginning ;)

-- Extra Challenges
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

{- The following exercises are considered optional. Some of them might be more
challenging. However, you still may find some of them easier than some of the
previous ones. Difficulty is a relative concept.
-}

-- | Write a function that takes a list of numbers and returns 'True'
-- if all the numbers are in the increasing order (i.e. the list is
-- sorted).
--
-- >>> isIncreasing [3, 1, 2]
-- False
-- >>> isIncreasing [1 .. 10]
-- True
isIncreasing :: [Int] -> Bool
isIncreasing [] = True
isIncreasing x  = all (== True) $ zipWith (<=) x (tail x)

-- | Implement a function that takes two lists, sorted in the
-- increasing order, and merges them into new list, also sorted in the
-- increasing order.
--
-- The lists are guaranteed to be given sorted, so you don't need to
-- verify that.
--
-- >>> merge [1, 2, 4] [3, 7]
-- [1,2,3,4,7]
merge :: [Int] -> [Int] -> [Int]
merge a [] = a
merge [] b = b
merge oa@(a:as) ob@(b:bs) | a <= b    = a : merge as ob
                          | otherwise = b : merge oa bs

-- | Implement the "Merge Sort" algorithm in Haskell. The @mergeSort@
-- function takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing the
-- same numbers but in the increasing order.
--
-- The algorithm of merge sort is the following:
--
--  1. If the given list has less than 2 elements, it's already sorted.
--  2. Otherwise, split list into two lists of the same size.
--  3. Sort each of two lists recursively.
--  4. Merge two resulting sorted lists to get a new sorted list.
--
-- >>> mergeSort [3, 1, 2]
-- [1,2,3]
mergeSort :: [Int] -> [Int]
mergeSort [] = []
mergeSort [a] = [a]
mergeSort as = let l = length as
                   left = take (div l 2) as
                   right = drop (div l 2) as
                in merge (mergeSort left) (mergeSort right)

-- | Haskell is famous for being a superb language for implementing
-- compilers and interpeters to other programming languages. In the next
-- tasks, you need to implement a tiny part of a compiler.
--
-- We're going to work on a small subset of arithmetic operations.
--
-- In programming we write expressions like "x + 1" or "y + x + 10".
-- Such expressions can be represented in a more structured way (than a
-- string) using the following recursive Algebraic Data Type:
data Expr
  = Lit Int
  | Var String
  | Add Expr Expr
  deriving (Show, Eq)

{- Now, you can use this data type to describe such expressions:

> x + 1
Add (Var "x") (Lit 1)

> y + x + 10
Add (Var "y") (Add (Var "x") (Lit 10))
-}

-- | We want to evaluate such expressions. We can associate a value
-- with a variable using a list of pairs.
--
-- You can use the @lookup@ function to search in this list by a variable name:
--
-- * https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.16.0.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:lookup
type Variables = [(String, Int)]

-- | Unfortunately, it's not guaranteed that variables in our @Expr@
-- data type are present in the given list. So we're going to introduce a
-- separate data for possible evaluation errors.
--
-- Normally, this would be a sum type with several constructors
-- describing all possible errors. But we have only one error in our
-- evaluation process.
data EvalError
  = VariableNotFound String
  deriving (Show, Eq)

-- | Having all this set up, we can finally implement an evaluation function.
-- It returns either a successful evaluation result or an error.
eval :: Variables -> Expr -> Either EvalError Int
eval _ (Lit x) = Right x
eval vs (Add l r) = let lr = eval vs l
                        rr = eval vs r
                     in (+) <$> lr <*> rr
eval vs (Var v) = let r = lookup v vs

-- | Compilers also perform optimizations! One of the most common
-- optimizations is "Constant Folding". It performs arithmetic operations
-- on all constants known during compile time. This way you can write
-- more verbose and clear code that works as efficient as its shorter
-- version.
--
-- For example, if you have an expression:
--
-- x + 10 + y + 15 + 20
--
-- The result of constant folding can be:
--
-- x + y + 45
--
-- It also can be:
--
-- x + 45 + y
--
-- Write a function that takes and expression and performs "Constant
-- Folding" optimization on the given expression.
